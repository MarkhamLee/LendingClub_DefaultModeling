    "This notebook performs a high level analysis of the loans in the dataset, primarily from the perspective of assessing financial performance, identifying drivers of defaults and identifying financial targets for the machine learning model. \n",
    "\n",
    "Key Statistics\n",
    "* Default Rate: 19.18% \n",
    "* Gains from good loans: ~912m\n",
    "* Losses from bad loans: ~560m\n",
    "* Net Gains: ~353m \n",
    "* The  loans in the bottom two \"grades\" are unprofitable overall, with the grade above it barely profitable (i.e. grades E, F, G) \n",
    "\n",
    "### What we've learned so far\n",
    "##### this data is repeated at the bottom of this notebook, but placed here for convenience)\n",
    "* Removing loans with an interest rate above 13.5% would wipe out about approximately 87M in gains, but increased annualized return on total loans by about 25%. The company would deploy 2.4 billion less in capital, but only earn around 87M less. An argument that Lending Club could find higher yield activities (~1.21% annualized gain) for ~2.4B. Note as if this writing (4/08/22) two year T-Bills are paying 2.51% and they were paying 1.63% a month ago. \n",
    "* Removing all loans below Class D barely changes net gains, but increases returns on the loan portfolio by about 15.6%. I.e. the loans below Class D barely broke even, while requiring nearly 1B less in lending funds to generate. \n",
    "* On average bad loans wipe out the gains from ~2.6 good loans. Meaning a \"false positive\" as far as giving a loan that will eventually go into default, is roughly 2.6X more expensive than rejecting a customer who would pay off their loan \n",
    "* In a perfect world, the company would earn about 5.9% annualized fromm its lending business, I.e. the loans that were paid in full delivered a 5.9% annnualized return \n",
    "* Even though F & G loans constitute only ~2.8% of all loans, the fact that both categories are a net loss means that LC should stop originating loans in this category \n",
    "* While we don't know how much it costs to service/manage an individual loan, the low average return (~333) of the loans in class E (8.22% of all loans) + the default rate of 37.9% suggests that the company should stop originating loans in that category as well. I.e. a loan clas with a high default rate suggests that this category is more expensive to manage than say Class A or B loans, meaning, once operational costs are removed from the gains from Class E, the return is probably significantly less than 333.00 \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For the purposes of this exercise, \"success\" will be a model that provides greater value than the two proposed interventions:\n",
    "* Not originating loans to customers with loan grades below D, meaning: <16.5% default rate, >351M in gains, <5.09B in deployed capital \n",
    "* Setting an interest cap at 13.5%, <3.6B in deployed capital, >270M in gains, <10.6% default rate\n",
    "\n",
    "There are clear options to improve the performance of LC lending portfolio, so for a model to provide business value it would have to outperform one or both of the intervention options identified via the EDA process. I.e. the model would need to provide a 3rd option that is superior to the other two, which are fairly standard banking options: increase your lending standards. "

This is probably most reflective of riskier customers being giving higher interest rates to shield LC against that risk, but given the burden caused by higher interest rates, LC is probably hurting themselves more than they are protecting against risk.The second item is that bad loans are very expensive, despite good loans outnumbering bad loans by nearly 4:1, the bad loans wiped out nearly 2/3rds of the gains from the good loans. I.e. every bad loan wiped out the gains from 2.6 good loans. "

    "### What we've learned so far:\n",
    "* Removing loans with an interest rate above 13.5% would wipe out about approximately 87M in gains, but increased annualized return on total loans by about 25%. The company would deploy 2.4 billion less in capital, but only earn around 87M less. An argument that Lending Club could find higher yield activities (~1.21% annualized gain) for ~2.4B. Note as if this writing (4/08/22) two year T-Bills are paying 2.51% and they were paying 1.63% a month ago. \n",
    "* Removing all loans below Class D barely changes net gains, but increases returns on the loan portfolio by about 15.6%. I.e. the loans below Class D barely broke even, while requiring nearly 1B less in lending funds to generate. \n",
    "* On average bad loans wipe out the gains from ~2.6 good loans. Meaning a \"false positive\" as far as giving a loan that will eventually go into default, is roughly 2.6X more expensive than rejecting a customer who would pay off their loan \n",
    "* In a perfect world, the company would earn about 5.9% annualized fromm its lending business, I.e. the loans that were paid in full delivered a 5.9% annnualized return \n",
    "* Even though F & G loans constitute only ~2.8% of all loans, the fact that both categories are a net loss means that LC should stop originating loans in this category \n",
    "* While we don't know how much it costs to service/manage an individual loan, the low average return (~333) of the loans in class E (8.22% of all loans) + the default rate of 37.9% suggests that the company should stop originating loans in that category as well. I.e. a loan clas with a high default rate suggests that this category is more expensive to manage than say Class A or B loans, meaning, once operational costs are removed from the gains from Class E, the return is probably significantly less than 333.00 \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For the purposes of this exercise, \"success\" will be a model that provides greater value than the two proposed interventions:\n",
    "* Not originating loans to customers with loan grades below D, meaning: <16.5% default rate, >351M in gains, <5.09B in deployed capital \n",
    "* Setting an interest cap at 13.5%, <3.6B in deployed capital, >270M in gains, <10.6% default rate\n",
    "\n",
    "There are clear options to improve the performance of LC lending portfolio, so for a model to provide business value it would have to outperform one or both of the intervention options identified via the EDA process. I.e. the model would need to provide a 3rd option that is superior to the other two, which are fairly standard banking options: increase your lending standards. \n"
